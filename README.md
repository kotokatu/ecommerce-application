# Ecommerce

## Project Description

Nowadays the shift in focus of sales operations for goods and services from hand-to-hand to virtual sales is driving us to put greater emphasis on electronic selling.

  So, as developers, we were asked to design and create an E-commerce web site which facilitates the communication between the product owners and the clients.

  This is a Single Page Application built using React. This website allows users to login, fetch info from the server, add/update/delete items into a cart and save the cart options to the server. The products have a title, image and description. It also has a shopping list page and user info with the ability to change address and other parameters. The website was hosted on GitHub pages. Authentication and Database is handled using Commerce Tools.
